# Application of ML concepts for Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Scikit-Learn 
# My Aim is to apply machine learning (ML) modeling skills 
# by using two very popular classification models to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions. 
# These models are: Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine. A real dataset is used to train each of these models. 
# The dataset includes information about 
# transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
# I used the trained model to assess if a credit card transaction is legitimate or not.
